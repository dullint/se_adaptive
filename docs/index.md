# CAI Documentation

Welcome to the CAI (Critique and Improve) documentation. CAI is a tool designed to help create and refine critique+rewrite examples for Constitutional AI training, specifically focusing on the critique+rewrite step described in the [Constitutional AI paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073).

## What is Constitutional AI?
Constitutional AI uses reinforcement learning from AI feedback to tune models to follow a set of human-written principles--collectively referred to as the constitution. In the critique+rewrite step, a teacher model critiques and rewrites an initial completion (generated by the student model) to better adhere to a given principle from the constitution.

## Current Principle

The current implementation focuses on the following principle:

!!! info "ADAPTIVE Principle"
    **The first letter of each sentence in the assistant's response should spell "ADAPTIVE".**

## Key Features

- **üìù Manual Drafting**: Interactively create and refine critique+rewrite examples with real-time feedback
- **ü§ñ Auto Generate**: Automatically generate new examples based on failure analysis of your test set
- **üìä Visualization**: View and analyze your examples collection with adherence validation
- **üìö Versioning**: Track and manage different versions of your examples library
- **üìà Evaluation**: Measure how well your examples help the teacher model follow the principle

## Tool Benefits

- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for creating and managing examples
- **LLM Integration**: Direct integration with GPT-4 for assistance in drafting examples
- **Quality Control**: Automatic validation of the ADAPTIVE principle adherence
- **Iterative Improvement**: Tools for continuous refinement of your examples collection
